		<p>This ia a port of the Java API provided with the RightFAX server for Python.
		It generally works the same but I tried to make it more pythonic where appropriate.
		Sorry, no real docs yet, but it generally works the same as as the Java API.</p>

		<p>This was developed for my own use. I am making it available because I thought
		it might be useful to others but I make no warranty of any kind. <b>Use at your own risk.</b></p>

		<p>I will try to answer email requests for support if I can. Feedback, positive or negative, would
		be appreciated (positive prefered of course :-).</p>
